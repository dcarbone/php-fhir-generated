/**
 * An event (i.e. any change to current patient status) that may be related to
 * unintended effects on a patient or research participant. The unintended effects
 * may require additional monitoring, treatment, hospitalization, or may result in
 * death. The AdverseEvent resource also extends to potential or avoided events
 * that could have had such effects. There are two major domains where the
 * AdverseEvent resource is expected to be used. One is in clinical care reported
 * adverse events and the other is in reporting adverse events in clinical research
 * trial management. Adverse events can be reported by healthcare providers,
 * patients, caregivers or by medical products manufacturers. Given the differences
 * between these two concepts, we recommend consulting the domain specific
 * implementation guides when implementing the AdverseEvent Resource. The
