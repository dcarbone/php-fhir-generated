/**
 * Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes
 * involved in producing and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource.
 * Provenance provides a critical foundation for assessing authenticity, enabling
 * trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions are a form of
 * contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own
 * provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of
 * confidence in authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and
 * stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document Completion - has the artifact been legally
 * authenticated), all of which may impact security, privacy, and trust policies.
