# php-fhir-generated
Pre-generated classes from [dcarbone/php-fhir](https://github.com/dcarbone/php-fhir)

This lib can either be used with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) or on it's own.

### Inclusion with Composer

composer.json require entry:

```json
{
   "dcarbone/php-fhir-generated": "v3.2.*"
}
```

### Autoloading without Composer

If you do not wish to use Composer, for whatever reason, I provide the class `PHPFHIRAutoloader` per version generated.

You can find it within the root of each versions' namespace path.
